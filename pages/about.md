## About the Collection

Stamps and Spacemen is a digital collection created for class ILS-Z 652 Digital Libraries, fall 2022 as a class project to gain experience with developing a digital collection. The collection’s focus is astrophilately, the depiction of astronauts and space travel in stamps. In this collection you will find digitized images of stamps depicting the Apollo missions, the fictional conquest of Venus, and many other subjects related to astronauts, space travel and the space race. Additionally, information about the stamps; their size, date, price, and country of origin are all made available for the interested user of this site wishing to know more about individual stamps in the collection.

## Context behind this Collection

The stamps found in this collection were sold in a packet called “Cosmic Encounters” being sold by Action Packets which was likely trying to tap into the popularity of the board game Cosmic Encounter, which came out in 1977. Acquiring this packet led to my personal interest in astrophilately. This is because the collection reminds me of my grandpa, who was notorious for being bad at playing cosmic encounter and who was the one who introduced me to stamp collecting and would work on stamps with me as a child. For these reasons, I feel a personal connection with this particular collection of stamps.
